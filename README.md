3. All the health-vitals data is stored vitals table (in app.db), SOS message, if any, in SOS table (in app.db), notifications, if any, in notifications table (in app.db)

4. To retrieve information from sqlite3 db in json format, visit (http://127.0.0.1:5000/Trial) in your browser. Here, it is built to retrieve the first row from the vitals table (from app.db)
